# Setting up your site

There are a few ways to get started building your Wax site, depending on your needs. Advanced Jekyllers can start a Jekyll site from scratch and add the `wax_theme` gem. __However, it is recommended that you clone the demo site and swap in your collection data and exhibition content__. This Wiki will show you how to do the latter.
