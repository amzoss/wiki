# Cloning the demo

1. Change directory into where you'd like your site, e.g., your Desktop:
    ```sh
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```
2. Download the Zip folder from the [wax github repository](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/). The option to download the Zip folder should be on the green button labeled "Clone or download." Your browser will save the file where it normally saves downloads.

3. Move the zip file to the location you will use. In our example, to the Desktop.

4. Unzip the file. This can be done through your operating system graphic user interface, or in the terminal:
    ```sh
    unzip wax-master.zip
    ```
    You can delete the zip folder once you're done.

5. Rename the directory and go inside the project folder:
    ```sh
    mv wax-master my-project
    cd wax-master
    ```

That's it!
