# *Unplatform* | When the Strategy is the System and the Workflow is Everything

#### By Marii Nyröp – 29 March 2018


##### Minimal computing is often positioned against the Platform (writ large) and outside the Content Management System (CMS). So what do we call the work of building and implementing minimal, cohesive "content management strategies"?

It's been almost four years since the [GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) "kickstarted itself into life." My work, though outside the group proper, has been largely informed by its principles and provocations, especially in projects for the spin-off initiative [Minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp/). When rereading the [thought pieces](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/) that have steadily emerged on minimal computing, I often compare my work to the standards put forward by their authors. I wonder, Does it count as [minimal maintenance](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/#minimal-maintenance) and [minimal use](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/#minimal-use) if an automated service is running tests on my behalf? How do I actually [minimize technical language](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/#minimal-technical-language) while preserving the benefits of a shared technical vocabulary?

In other words, I'm deep in the weeds of *doing* minimal computing, and this brings about new questions, issues, and musings. Though I have great advice to guide me, the work-as-done is never the work-as-imagined.

For example, it is frequently difficult to say what exactly the work of minimal computing comprises. I can explain its importance and point to its postulates, yet its products are often too slippery to define. This is particularly true for the Minicomp project [Wax](/wax/#top). When I attempt to describe its contours, lists and jargon sputter out instead. It's a framework! a set of prototypes! proofs-of-concept! scholarly things! a set of sets of things! It's like Omeka but also not at all!

Essentially, the riddle is this: If Wax is neither platform nor content management system, but it is a cohesive activity, what is it? In theory, Wax is a chimera of new and preexisting tools, with no extraneous dependencies, assembled for creating scholarly exhibitions of all shapes and sizes. But in practice, it's __a loose framework of a few tools with shared strategies and user labor, expertise, and curiosity filling in the many gaps__. It's a clear data model and supporting cast of workflows, plus some software and elbow grease thrown in.

If this characterization seems dismissive or evasive, it's only a byproduct of speaking in the negative (it's not this! not that!) and, more importantly, of hidden assumptions on platforms and the comparative incompleteness of anything less turnkey.

Wax might actually be better understood as kind of *unplatform*—as an alternative way to work when a platform is unsuited, unnecessary, or otherwise unavailable. It might be viewed as another option on the table, to be considered for a project alongside or in conjunction with existing platforms. And while prepending "un" to a word is potentially threadbare, I hope it is justifiable here especially as a verb. To *unplatform* a project might imply detangling it (e.g., process from product and tool from workflow) or elaborating what has made it possible (e.g., what are the intangibles here?)

In short: this work deserves a positive, coherent terminology. It's difficult enough to deal with the problems of developing minimal computing practices without needing to justify the not-platform.
