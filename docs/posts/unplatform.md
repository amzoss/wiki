# Sharing the *Unplatform*<br>When Strategy is the System

#### By Marii Nyröp – 29 March 2018

It's been almost four years since the [GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) "kickstarted itself into life." Though outside the group proper, I've found my daily work shaped by its principles and provocations—especially in projects for the spin-off initiative [Minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp/).

In rereading the [thought pieces](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/) that have steadily emerged on minimal computing, I often compare my work to the standards they set. I wonder, Does it count as 'minimal maintenance' and 'minimal use' if an automated service is running tests on my behalf? And, How do I minimize technical language while preserving the benefits of a shared technical vocabulary? In short: I'm in the weeds of *doing* minimal computing, and though I have great advice to guide me, the Work-as-Done is never the Work-as-Imagined.<sup>1</sup>

In addition to the questions above, a key issue I've encountered in doing minimal computing work is explaining what the work constitutes. I can explain its importance and point to its postulates, yet its products are often too slippery to define.

Take for example the Minicomp project [Wax](/wax/#top). When I try to describe it, lists of jargon spill out. It's a set of prototypes! proofs-of-concepts! scholarly workflows! things! a set of sets of things! This is a problem common to the digital humanities and iterative work in general.<sup>2</sup> In my case, however, defining the work is not tied to academic promotion, but rather the to usability of what I produce.
