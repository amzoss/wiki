# Minicomp

Minicomp is a collaborative effort in embedding __minimal computing principles__ (e.g. [Minimal Maintenance](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/#minimal-maintenance), [Minimal Dependencies](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/#minimal-dependencies), and [Minimal Connectivity](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/#minimal-connectivity)) in __digital humanities__ methods.

We create __workflows__, __components__, and __proofs-of-concept__, and the results are rarely turnkey. As such, we welcome contributors of all kinds and [define contributions broadly](/contributors).

This site includes documentation for our main projects, and will likely serve as a repository for blog posts and tutorials in the future.
