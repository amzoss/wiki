# Adding your collection data


Before adding your collection data, take note of the project's structure, including:

| directory   | purpose   |
|:------------|:----------|
| `_data`     | where raw, unprocessed images and metadata files go. <br>these will not be output to the compiled static site. |
| `_qatar`    | where the pages for each collection item in the `qatar` collection were generated. <br>if you have a collection called `photos` the pages will be generated to a directory `_photos`.  |
| `img/derivatives`   | where the image derivatives are generated after running the `wax:img:derivatives` task  |

More information on Jekyll directory and file conventions can be found in the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).


## Delete demo data and files and directories generated by wax tasks

After exploring the site and its files, delete the following demo files and directories:

- `_qatar` directory
- `img/derivatives` directory

You can do this manually or you can run the command
```sh
bundle exec rake wax:clobber qatar
```

Also delete any `qatar` files and folders within `_data`.

## Swap in your collection data

- Drag your own directory of images (named after your collection) into `_data/raw_images`
- Drag your own metadata records (i.e. your .csv, .json, or .yml file) into `_data`

#### \***TIP!** It's a good idea to make a copy of your metadata file since Wax will alter and add fields to your main copy. (e.g., `qatar.csv` and `qatar-original.csv`)
