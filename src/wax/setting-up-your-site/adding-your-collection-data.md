# Adding your collection data


Before adding your collection data, take note of the project's structure.

| directory   | purpose   |
|:------------|:----------|
| `_data`     | where raw, unprocessed images and metadata files go. <br>these will not be output to the compiled static site. |
| `_qatar`    | where the pages for each collection item in the `qatar` collection were generated. <br>if you have a collection called `photos` the pages will be generated to a directory `_photos`.  |
| `img/derivatives`   | where the image derivatives are generated after running the `wax:img:derivatives` task  |

More information on Jekyll directory and file conventions can be found in the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).


## Delete demo data and files and directories generated by wax tasks

After exploring the site and its files, delete the following demo files and directories:

- `qatar` directory within `_data/raw_images`
- `qatar.csv` file within `_data`
- `_qatar` directory
- `img/derivatives` directory

## Swap in your data

- Drag your own directory of images (named after your collection) into `_data/raw_images`
- Drag your own metadata records (i.e. your .csv, .json, or .yml file) into `_data`
